Sugar Calendar is a commercial WordPress plugin by [Sandhills Development](https://sandhillsdevelopment.com).

A license key must be purchased at [SugarCalendar.com](https://sugarcalendar.com). (Looking for [Lite](https://github.com/sugarcalendar/lite/)?)

Development happens here in a private GitHub repository to better facilitate contributions from a dedicated community of users, developers, designers, and you. If you have a suggestion, bug report, patch, or pull request, please feel free to submit it here.

If you are using Sugar Calendar on a live site, you must obtain a license key from the [Sugar Calendar website](https://sugarcalendar.com).

As a matter of policy, we only provide support to users with valid license keys, and do not provide support otherwise.
