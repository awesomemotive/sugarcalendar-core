A sweet, simple event calendar plugin. Create your events and show them on a simple calendar. That's it.

* Ajax Enabled Calendar View
* Events Custom Post Type
* Simple Event Configuration
* Easily Set Event Dates
* Easily Set Event Start and End Time
* A short code for showing the calendar of events
* Events Archive, Listed by Date of Occurrence

= Extended Features =

A full version of this plugin with additional features is [available for purchase](http://pippinsplugins.com/sugar-event-calendar-wordpress/). It includes recurring events, large and small calendar views, event categories, widgets for displaying calendars and event filters, and more.
