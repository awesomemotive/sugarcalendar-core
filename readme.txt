You can easily manage events with this lightweight calendar. No complicated configuration. Simple to use. Sweeeet!

== Description ==

We believe that it should be easy to get a calendar on your website and start managing events! Sugar Calendar will quickly and easily enable you to do that.

Most event calendar plugins are either way too simple, or overly complex and bloated. Sugar Calendar is lightweight and provides the major features you need for event management.

= Simple is sweet. =

> “Sugar Calendar is now my go to calendar due to its simplicity with adding new events. I've found that it was so much easier for my clients to use than some of the other event/calendar plugins out there while providing the features they needed most.”

> _Jeff Brigman | VerticalHosts.com_


= Features =

**Simple event management** - Forget about complicated, cumbersome interfaces and do more with less. Our beautiful admin calendar interface will delight admins and clients on your website’s back-end.

**Event categories** - Assign events to specific categories. Then display calendars for just those specific categories or display a master calendar with all categories.

**Start and end times** - All events can be assigned a starting and end time. Both start and end dates are optional, supporting all-day or specific-duration events.

**Customize date and time format** - Display dates and times however you want, you can select from all the most common formats, or cutomize it to your exact liking.
